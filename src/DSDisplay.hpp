/* This class allows you to pack data into an SFML packet and send it to an
 * application on the DriverStation that displays it in a GUI.
 *
 * USAGE:
 * 1) Call DSDisplay::getInstance() to create an instance of this
 *    class. The port number passed in should be the port on which
 *    communications will be received (probably 1130).
 * 2) Call clear() on the pointer to empty the packet before adding new data.
 * 3) Add new data with the << operator (e.g. dsDisplay << 4.f; dsDisplay << myVar;).
 * 4) After all data is packed, call sendToDS() to send the data to the Driver
 *    Station.
 *
 * Extract the received packet on the DriverStation with the >> operator like
 * any other SFML packet.
 *
 * receiveFromDS() requires that the file GUISettings.txt exist in
 * "/c", which follows the convention described in the
 * DSDisplay's readme. This class creates a file "autonMode.txt"
 * internally to store the currently selected autonomous routine.
 *
 * Before sending HUD data to the DriverStation, call clear() followed by
 * calls to addElementData() and a call to sendToDS(). If clear() isn't
 * called first, undefined behavior may result. (The header "display\r\n" isn't
 * inserted when the packet isn't empty.)
 *
 * Note: It doesn't matter in which order the data in the received packet is
 *       extracted in the application on the Driver Station.
 *
 * The packets are always sent to 10.35.12.42 for testing purposes

     * messes up floats over the network.
